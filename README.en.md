**Language: [简体中文](README.md) | English**

**LLM based Literature Search Agent.** PaperSeek helps researchers start literature searches in natural language, iteratively refine database queries, expand candidate papers through citation links, rank records, and export a reviewable paper list.

Try it online: [Live Demo](https://www.paperseek.xyz/). The hosted demo uses ModelScope account sign-in, runs model calls with the signed-in user's API Inference quota, and stores search history in the hosted service. See the [hosted demo guide](docs/online-demo.md) for details.

Deployment guide: [Docker and Vercel deployment](docs/deployment.md).

## Overview

PaperSeek turns a research question into an observable search workflow:

- Enter a research question in Chinese or English.
- Let an LLM generate source-specific search queries.
- Automatically broaden or narrow queries according to target result counts.
- Normalize metadata such as title, authors, venue, year, DOI, abstract, citation count, keywords, and links.
- Ask the LLM to score candidate papers for relevance.
- Optionally expand high-matching OpenAlex records through forward citations and backward references.
- Review the workflow, ranked results, and citation map in the Web UI, then export selected records as CSV.

PaperSeek is designed for first-pass paper discovery and metadata organization. It does not replace systematic review protocols, full-text access, copyright checks, or expert judgement.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Natural-language search | Start from a research question instead of hand-writing database syntax. |
| Iterative query refinement | Automatically adjusts queries to hit a target result range, with 5 iterations by default. |
| Relevance ranking | Uses an LLM to score candidates and explain each score briefly. |
| OpenAlex citation expansion | Adds references and citing works from high-matching seed papers. |
| Result export | Select papers in the Results view and export them as CSV. |
| Citation map | Shows citation direction with arrows; supports drag, zoom, and pan. |
| CLI and Web UI | Run from the command line or through a local browser interface. |
| Local history | Self-hosted installs save search runs, events, and ranked records to local SQLite by default. |
| Docker / Vercel deployment | Supports full Docker deployments and Vercel demos. |
| Diagnostics | `doctor`, `smoke`, and `sources` help debug API keys, source adapters, and protocol settings. |
| Optional Agent Skill | `skills/paperseek/` can be copied into skill-aware agent platforms without being installed with the Python package. |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MingfengHong/paperseek.git
cd paperseek
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MingfengHong/paperseek.git
cd paperseek
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

Start the Web UI:

```bash
paperseek-web
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

You can also run a search directly from the CLI:

```bash
paperseek "open innovation and digital platforms" --source openalex
```

## Deployment

Docker is the recommended path for the full Web UI:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Vercel can host quick demos and lightweight Web UI deployments:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMingfengHong%2Fpaperseek)

For long searches, citation expansion, and heavy repeated use, prefer Docker or a VPS. See the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for details.

## Minimal Configuration

PaperSeek needs at least one LLM provider. OpenAlex is the default data source. Anonymous OpenAlex access is enough for quick tests, but a free API key is recommended for more stable use.

DeepSeek example:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek
export LLM_API_TYPE=openai_chat
export LLM_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
export LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
export LLM_API_KEY=your-llm-api-key
paperseek-web
```

CSTCloud example:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=cstcloud
export LLM_API_TYPE=openai_chat
export LLM_MODEL=DeepSeek-V4-Flash
export LLM_BASE_URL=https://uni-api.cstcloud.cn/v1
export LLM_API_KEY=your-cstcloud-api-key
paperseek-web
```

ModelScope API-Inference example:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=modelscope
export LLM_API_TYPE=openai_chat
export LLM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507
export LLM_BASE_URL=https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1
export LLM_API_KEY=your-modelscope-token
paperseek-web
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:LLM_PROVIDER = "deepseek"
$env:LLM_API_TYPE = "openai_chat"
$env:LLM_MODEL = "deepseek-v4-flash"
$env:LLM_BASE_URL = "https://api.deepseek.com"
$env:LLM_API_KEY = "your-llm-api-key"
paperseek-web
```

Local Ollama does not require an LLM API key:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
export LLM_API_TYPE=openai_chat
export LLM_MODEL=qwen3:8b
export LLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
paperseek-web
```

The repository includes `.env.example`. Copy it to `.env` for local reference, but never commit real API keys.

## Web UI

The Web UI has four main workspaces:

| View | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Enter the research question, configure data source, LLM, iterations, and target result range; watch workflow stages and system logs. |
| Results | Review ranked papers, search, filter, sort, select, and export paper CSV. |
| Citation Map | Explore OpenAlex citation expansion as a directed graph. |
| History | Review locally saved runs, final queries, ranked records, and run events. |

API keys, base URLs, and run parameters entered in the Web UI are used only for the current browser session and are not written to local config files by PaperSeek. Local history saves run summaries, queries, events, and results, but never raw API keys.

CSV files exported from Results use the research-question theme and local date in the filename.

## CLI Usage

Basic search:

```bash
paperseek "responsible AI governance in public sector" --source openalex
```

Explicit subcommand:

```bash
paperseek search "digital platforms and open innovation" --source openalex
```

JSON output:

```bash
paperseek search "open innovation" --source openalex --output json
```

Common options:

```bash
paperseek search "your research question" \
  --source openalex \
  --field management \
  --min 5 \
  --max 50 \
  --iterations 5 \
  --llm-provider deepseek \
  --llm-api-type openai_chat \
  --llm-model deepseek-v4-flash \
  --llm-base-url https://api.deepseek.com \
  --llm-key your-llm-api-key
```

Run diagnostics:

```bash
paperseek doctor
paperseek doctor --source openalex --json
```

Run a minimal real data-source request:

```bash
paperseek smoke --source openalex --query "machine learning"
paperseek smoke --source crossref --query "open innovation" --json
```

List source capabilities:

```bash
paperseek sources
paperseek sources --json
```

Review local history:

```bash
paperseek history list
paperseek history show <RUN_ID> --json
paperseek history path
```

Manage user-level CLI config:

```bash
paperseek config path
paperseek config set LLM_API_KEY your-llm-api-key
paperseek config list
paperseek config unset LLM_API_KEY
```

Environment variables override user-level config. `paperseek config list` masks secret values.

## Data Sources

| Source | Default status | API key | Best for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAlex | Default | Recommended | Precise search, abstracts, citation counts, citation expansion, citation maps | Open scholarly metadata source for broad discovery and citation exploration. |
| Crossref | Supported | Usually not required | DOI checks, publication metadata, journal and publisher validation | DOI and metadata registry; useful for metadata verification and DOI completion. |
| Web of Science Starter | Adapter retained | Required | Users with approved Clarivate API access | Commercial database API; availability and returned fields depend on subscription and institutional entitlement. |

## LLM Providers

PaperSeek supports two mainstream API protocol families: OpenAI-style APIs and Anthropic Messages API. Provider selects service defaults; API Type selects request format.

| Provider | Default API Type | Default model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `openai_responses` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic_messages` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Google Gemini | `openai_chat` | `gemini-3.5-flash` |
| DeepSeek | `openai_chat` | `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| CSTCloud | `openai_chat` | `DeepSeek-V4-Flash` |
| DashScope | `openai_chat` | `qwen3.6-plus` |
| Kimi Moonshot | `openai_chat` | `kimi-k2.6` |
| Zhipu AI GLM | `openai_chat` | `glm-5.1` |
| SiliconFlow | `openai_chat` | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` |
| OpenRouter | `openai_chat` | `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` |
| Volcengine Ark | `openai_chat` | `doubao-seed-2-0-mini-260428` |
| Tencent Hunyuan | `openai_chat` | `hunyuan-turbos-latest` |
| Baidu Qianfan | `openai_chat` | `ernie-5.0` |
| ModelScope | `openai_chat` | `Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507` |
| Ollama | `openai_chat` | `qwen3:8b` |
| Custom | `openai_chat` | Empty; fill in your own model |

Default models initialize forms and examples. Actual availability depends on provider accounts, regions, billing, and compatibility layers.

## Workflow

A search usually has four stages:

1. **Query Generation**: the LLM creates an initial query from the research question and optional field hint.
2. **Source Search**: PaperSeek requests OpenAlex, Crossref, or WoS Starter and logs HTTP status and hit counts.
3. **Query Refinement**: if the hit count is too low or too high, the LLM adjusts the query and continues.
4. **Ranking & Results**: the candidate pool is scored by the LLM, and the top records are returned.

When OpenAlex citation expansion is enabled, PaperSeek selects high-matching seed papers, adds references and citing works, then ranks the complete candidate pool. The current default maximum output is 50 papers.

## Citation Map

Citation Map uses arrows for citation direction:

```text
A -> B means A cites B
```

Graph nodes come from final results and OpenAlex citation expansion records. You can drag nodes, zoom and pan the canvas, and inspect node details. The citation map is useful for finding classic works, adjacent topics, and recent follow-up papers that keyword search may miss.

## Getting API Access

### OpenAlex

OpenAlex supports anonymous access, but a free API key is recommended:

1. Open [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) and create an account.
2. Visit [OpenAlex API settings](https://openalex.org/settings/api).
3. Copy the API key.
4. Fill `OpenAlex API Key` in the Web UI or set `OPENALEX_API_KEY`.

### Crossref

Crossref REST API usually does not require an API key. Set a contact email to enter the polite pool:

```bash
export CROSSREF_EMAIL=you@example.org
```

For higher quotas, priority support, or production SLA, consider Crossref Metadata Plus. PaperSeek uses the public or polite REST API path.

### CSTCloud LLM API

CSTCloud provides an OpenAI API Compatible LLM endpoint. The Base URL is `https://uni-api.cstcloud.cn/v1`. PaperSeek's provider id is `cstcloud`, and its default model is `DeepSeek-V4-Flash`.

To get an API key:

1. Open [CSTCloud API Keys](https://uni-api.cstcloud.cn/api_keys).
2. Sign in with CSTCloud unified authentication.
3. Fill and submit the requested application information on the page to obtain an API key.
4. Chinese Academy of Sciences intramural users can sign in with a CSTCloud Pass, usually their institutional email account and password.
5. Fill `LLM API Key` in the Web UI, or set `LLM_PROVIDER=cstcloud` and `LLM_API_KEY=your-cstcloud-api-key`.

See the [CSTCloud LLM API manual](https://uni-api.cstcloud.cn/doc/llm/) for endpoint details.

### Web of Science Starter API

WoS Starter requires approval in Clarivate Developer Portal and usually fits users with institutional Web of Science access:

1. Open the [Clarivate Developer Portal signup page](https://developer.clarivate.com/signup) and register.
2. Prefer an institutional email and, if possible, use the same identity as your Web of Science account.
3. Go to [Applications](https://developer.clarivate.com/applications) and click `Register Application`.
4. Fill application metadata:
   - `Application ID` should use digits, lowercase letters, `-`, or `_`.
   - `Application Name` can be your institution or project name.
   - `Application Description` can mention Web of Science API search.
   - Keep `Client Type` as `Public: Single Page Application`.
   - Do not enable OAuth2.0 flows.
5. Open [Web of Science Starter API](https://developer.clarivate.com/apis/wos-starter).
6. Select the registered application and click `Subscribe`.
7. Choose the plan that matches your identity and institutional entitlement.
8. Wait for approval after `Subscription approval is pending`.
9. After receiving the API key, fill `WoS API Key` in the Web UI or set `WOS_API_KEY`.

WoS Starter limits, fields, and availability depend on plan and institutional entitlement. For HTTP 401, check HTTPS and the key. For Clarivate's non-standard HTTP 512, check Clarivate service status, subscription approval, and query compatibility.

## Agent Skill

The repository includes an optional PaperSeek Skill:

```text
skills/paperseek/
```

It teaches skill-aware AI agents how to call the `paperseek` CLI and local Web UI, choose data sources, run diagnostics, parse JSON results, and respect citation-map boundaries. The Skill uses progressive disclosure: `SKILL.md` stays short, while detailed command contracts live in `references/`.

This Skill is **not installed automatically** with the Python package. If you need it, copy or link `skills/paperseek/` into the target agent platform's skill directory.

The launcher:

```text
skills/paperseek/scripts/paperseek.py
```

only calls the full PaperSeek Python package. It does not maintain a dependency-free fallback implementation. For standalone Skill distribution, install PaperSeek first or set `PAPERSEEK_PROJECT_ROOT` to a local source checkout.

## Project Status

PaperSeek is currently alpha software. CLI, Web UI, OpenAlex, Crossref, citation expansion, CSV export, and the optional Skill are usable, but formal research conclusions should still be reviewed manually.

Contributions are welcome:

- New data-source adapters.
- More robust query-generation and ranking prompts.
- Better citation graph interactions.
- Tests for Web API, CLI, provider parsing, and export behavior.
- Documentation, examples, and error diagnostics.
